Agenda:

1. Integration points
    - [readme](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppInsights-aspnetv5/blob/master/Readme.md)
    - We need to add UseRequestServices(). Should we do it explicitly or implicitly inside "UseApplicationInsights()"?
2. DI design and Application Insights:
    - What is currently implemented
    - Discuss what we plan to implement
3. Getting routing information
    - Types of applications supported for routing?
    - Can/should we use mvc.core?
    - How can we access routing information?
4. Ship next week (without core support) - CTP6 or RC?
5. Build/test infra best practices


Current DI design
-----------------
This is how customers reports telemetry today:
```
TelemetryClient telemetry = new TelemetryClient();
telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame");
```
```TelemetryClinet``` will be using configuration set in static singleton ```TelemetryConfiguration.Active``` (unless you pass new configuration as a parameter).

Every telemetry item should be associated with the list of context-specific properties. We are using mechanism of telemetry initializers to accomplish that. List of telemetry initializers is a property of ```TelemetryConfiguration.Active```.

This is how we initialize application insights today:
```
public static void AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config)
{
  ActiveConfigurationManager.AddInstrumentationKey(TelemetryConfiguration.Active, config);

  services.AddSingleton((svcs) => {
    ActiveConfigurationManager.AddTelemetryInitializers(TelemetryConfiguration.Active, svcs);
    ActiveConfigurationManager.AddContextInitializers(TelemetryConfiguration.Active);

    return new TelemetryClient();
  });

  services.AddScoped<RequestTelemetry>((svcs) => {
    var rt = new RequestTelemetry();
    // this is workaround to inject proper instrumentation key into javascript:
    rt.Context.InstrumentationKey = svcs.GetService<TelemetryClient>().Context.InstrumentationKey;
    return rt;
  });
}
```

Here is how telemetry initializer will look like:
```
public class ClientIpHeaderTelemetryInitializer : ITelemetryInitializer
{
  public ClientIpHeaderTelemetryInitializer(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    : base(httpContextAccessor)
  {
    this.httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
  }

  public void Initialize(ITelemetry telemetry)
  {
    var context = this.httpContextAccessor.Value;

    if (context == null)
    {
      //TODO: Diagnostics!
      return;
    }

    if (context.RequestServices == null)
    {
      //TODO: Diagnostics!
      return;
    }

    var request = context.RequestServices.GetService<RequestTelemetry>();

    if (request == null)
    {
      //TODO: Diagnostics!
       return;
     }

     this.OnInitializeTelemetry(context, request, telemetry);
  }
}
```



```
// TODO: Register if customer did not register
app.UseRequestServices();
```



Routes
------

Here is how a request-scoped component can access MVC route data. This is an injection constructor, but it can also be resolved from ```HttpContext.RequestServices``` service provider.

```
public MyComponent(IScopedInstance<ActionContext> actionContextAccessor)
{
  RouteData foo = actionContextAccessor.Value.RouteData;
}
```

The code that makes it possible is in the ```InvokeActionAsync``` method of the ```MvcRouteHandler```. 

Notice, however, that ```ActionContext``` is MVC specific while ```RouteData``` is not. Ideally weâ€™d want to avoid MVC dependencies and support other One ASP.NET frameworks, like WebForms, Dynamic Data, Web Pages, all of which support modern URL routing and would be a subject to the same cardinality problems with our service.

Ideally, I think that we want to work with the ASP.NET team and implement this in the ```RouterMiddleware``` so that we can access ```IScopedInstance<RouteContext>``` in our components instead of relying on platform-specific workarounds.
